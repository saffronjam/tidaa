# Android-TicTacToe-ImageView
This example covers (very basic):
- Using ImageView(s) to display images and as controls 
- Custom layout component, SquareLayout, a subclass to LinearLayout, keeping content inside a square (representing the tic-tac-toe board). NB! activity_main.xml uses fill_parent/wrap_content differenetly in portrait and landscape mode respectively.
- Load drawables, like style or images, from res/drawables
- Text to speech 
- Animation with ValueAnimator
